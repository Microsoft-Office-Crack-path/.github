These can be downloaded for free and support many of the same file formats as Microsoft Office.
Things to Keep in Mind:
Pirated Versions: While some websites claim to offer "free" Microsoft Office downloads, these versions are often illegal and may come with malware or other risks. Itâ€™s important to stick to legitimate sources.
Subscription Costs: The full versions of Microsoft Office and Microsoft 365 require a paid subscription, typically around $70/year for Microsoft 365 Personal, or more for family plans and business use.
